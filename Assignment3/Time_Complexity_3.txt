Question:

If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(1), then the complexity of it is ?

a) constant
b) polynomial
c) exponential

Solution:

a) constant

If an algorithm has a time complexity of O(1), it means that the time taken by the algorithm to execute doesn't depend on the size of the input. 
It has a constant execution time, regardless of the input size.
