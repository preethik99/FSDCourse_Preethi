Q1. Amazing Subarrays

You are given a string S, and you have to find all the amazing substrings of S.

An amazing Substring is one that starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, A, E, I, O, U).

Input

Only argument given is string S.

Output

Return a single integer X mod 10003, here X is the number of Amazing Substrings in given the string.
Constraints

1 <= length(S) <= 10^6
S can have special characters
Example

Input
    ABEC

Output
    6

Explanation
    Amazing substrings of given string are :
    1. A
    2. AB
    3. ABE
    4. ABEC
    5. E
    6. EC
    here number of substrings are 6 and 6 % 10003 = 6.

Q2. Even Subarrays


Problem Description
You are given an integer array A.

Decide whether it is possible to divide the array into one or more subarrays of even length such that the first and last element of all subarrays will be even.

Return "YES" if it is possible; otherwise, return "NO" (without quotes).



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A|, A[i] <= 10^6



Input Format
The first and the only input argument is an integer array, A.



Output Format
Return a string "YES" or "NO" denoting the answer.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [2, 4, 8, 6]
Input 2:

 A = [2, 4, 8, 7, 6]


Example Output
Output 1:

 "YES"
Output 2:

 "NO"


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 We can divide A into [2, 4] and [8, 6].
Explanation 2:

 There is no way to divide the array into even length subarrays.

Q3. Leaders in an array



Problem Description
Given an integer array A containing N distinct integers, you have to find all the leaders in array A. An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.

NOTE: The rightmost element is always a leader.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^8


Input Format
There is a single input argument which a integer array A


Output Format
Return an integer array denoting all the leader elements of the array.


Example Input
Input 1:
 A = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Input 2:
 A = [5, 4]


Example Output
Output 1:
[17, 2, 5]
Output 2:
[5, 4]


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
 Element 17 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 2 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 So we will return these three elements i.e [17, 2, 5], we can also return [2, 5, 17] or [5, 2, 17] or any other ordering.
Explanation 2:
 Element 5 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 Element 4 is strictly greater than all the elements on the right side to it.
 So we will return these two elements i.e [5, 4], we can also any other ordering.
