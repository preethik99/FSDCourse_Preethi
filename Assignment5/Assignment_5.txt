Q2. Special Index

Problem Description
Given an array, arr[] of size N, the task is to find the count of array indices such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal.



Problem Constraints
1 <= n <= 10^5
-10^5 <= A[i] <= 10^5


Input Format
First argument contains an array A of integers of size N


Output Format
Return the count of array indices such that removing an element from these indices makes the sum of even-indexed and odd-indexed array elements equal.



Example Input
Input 1:
A=[2, 1, 6, 4]
Input 2:

A=[1, 1, 1]


Example Output
Output 1:
1
Output 2:

3


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:
Removing arr[1] from the array modifies arr[] to { 2, 6, 4 } such that, arr[0] + arr[2] = arr[1]. 
Therefore, the required output is 1. 
Explanation 2:

Removing arr[0] from the given array modifies arr[] to { 1, 1 } such that arr[0] = arr[1] 
Removing arr[1] from the given array modifies arr[] to { 1, 1 } such that arr[0] = arr[1] 
Removing arr[2] from the given array modifies arr[] to { 1, 1 } such that arr[0] = arr[1] 
Therefore, the required output is 3.

Q3. Pick from both sides!


Problem Description
You are given an integer array A of size N.

You have to perform B operations. In one operation, you can remove either the leftmost or the rightmost element of the array A.

Find and return the maximum possible sum of the B elements that were removed after the B operations.

NOTE: Suppose B = 3, and array A contains 10 elements, then you can:

Remove 3 elements from front and 0 elements from the back, OR
Remove 2 elements from front and 1 element from the back, OR
Remove 1 element from front and 2 elements from the back, OR
Remove 0 elements from front and 3 elements from the back.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5

1 <= B <= N

-10^3 <= A[i] <= 10^3



Input Format
First argument is an integer array A.

Second argument is an integer B.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the maximum possible sum of elements you removed.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [5, -2, 3 , 1, 2]
 B = 3
Input 2:

 A = [ 2, 3, -1, 4, 2, 1 ]
 B = 4


Example Output
Output 1:

 8
Output 2:

 9


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Remove element 5 from front and element (1, 2) from back so we get 5 + 1 + 2 = 8
Explanation 2:

 Remove the first element and the last 3 elements. So we get 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 9

Q1. Special Subsequences "AG"


Problem Description
You have given a string A having Uppercase English letters.

You have to find how many times subsequence "AG" is there in the given string.

NOTE: Return the answer modulo 109 + 7 as the answer can be very large.



Problem Constraints
1 <= length(A) <= 10^5



Input Format
First and only argument is a string A.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the answer.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = "ABCGAG"
Input 2:

 A = "GAB"


Example Output
Output 1:

 3
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Subsequence "AG" is 3 times in given string 
Explanation 2:

 There is no subsequence "AG" in the given string.

Q2. Closest MinMax


Problem Description
Given an array A, find the size of the smallest subarray such that it contains at least one occurrence of the maximum value of the array

and at least one occurrence of the minimum value of the array.



Problem Constraints
1 <= |A| <= 2000



Input Format
First and only argument is vector A



Output Format
Return the length of the smallest subarray which has at least one occurrence of minimum and maximum element of the array



Example Input
Input 1:

A = [1, 3, 2]
Input 2:

A = [2, 6, 1, 6, 9]


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

 3


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Take the 1st and 2nd elements as they are the minimum and maximum elements respectievly.
Explanation 2:

 Take the last 3 elements of the array.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q3. Bulbs

Problem Description
A wire connects N light bulbs.

Each bulb has a switch associated with it; however, due to faulty wiring, a switch also changes the state of all the bulbs to the right of the current bulb.

Given an initial state of all bulbs, find the minimum number of switches you have to press to turn on all the bulbs.

You can press the same switch multiple times.

Note: 0 represents the bulb is off and 1 represents the bulb is on.



Problem Constraints
0 <= N <= 5Ã—10^5
0 <= A[i] <= 1



Input Format
The first and the only argument contains an integer array A, of size N.



Output Format
Return an integer representing the minimum number of switches required.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [0, 1, 0, 1]
Input 2:

 A = [1, 1, 1, 1]


Example Output
Output 1:

 4
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 press switch 0 : [1 0 1 0]
 press switch 1 : [1 1 0 1]
 press switch 2 : [1 1 1 0]
 press switch 3 : [1 1 1 1]
Explanation 2:

 There is no need to turn any switches as all the bulbs are already on.
